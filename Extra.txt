For the extra learning I took a look at addition functionality of git add -i.  I mainly looked at staging and reverting files as well as the diff command in the same window.  I also looked at git stash, since that is actually pretty awesome.  It is nice to be able to save the state of a program without having to worry about commiting it in order to switch to a different branch.  I created the file practice.py to work with these commands, and I believe when I push this file for the last time, practice will not have changed.
